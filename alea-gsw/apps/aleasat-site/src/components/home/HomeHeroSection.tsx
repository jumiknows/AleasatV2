                Earth-observation satellite that can be used by radio amateurs
                to assist in disaster relief operations. Equipped with an
                on-board camera, ALEASAT will allow radio amateurs to request
                imagery of a specific location on Earth, and then downlink that
                imagery directly from the satellite.

                In contrast to methods used by most other amateur satellites
                with an Earth observation capability, ALEASATâ€™s targeted
                approach has direct applications to disaster monitoring and
                relief activities.

                This project can serve as a precursor to a future amateur
                satellite constellation dedicated to disaster monitoring. In
                addition to ALEASAT itself, the team is also building the
                necessary ground station infrastructure in order to communicate
                with the satellite.
