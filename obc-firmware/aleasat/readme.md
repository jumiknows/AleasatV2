# ALEASAT

This folder contains files specific to ALEASAT. It should have the same file structure as the orcasat folder.

If you are adding new drivers / files that do more than simply changing the functionality of the existing orcasat
code then it should live in this folder.

If you make a new folder don't forget to include it. Left click on OBC2 in the Project Explorer. Click on Properties,
then Show Advanced Settings at the bottom of the pop-up box. Then under CCS Build > ARM Compiler > Include Options.

You can click on the file+ icon and add the directory so it gets included in your build.
