# Background
Welcome to CDH!

# Objective
Now that you have completed the [Getting Started](https://wiki.aleasat.space/en/space-segment/cdh/getting-started) setup steps, its time to do your first project. You should be able to find the details for this task in the [Onboarding Project](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1H23aaEJ0PNJ2So-cSFxMD1-29CTJ69CEihQPknLmP6Q/edit) file.

# Implementation
Follow the steps in the [Onboarding Project](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1H23aaEJ0PNJ2So-cSFxMD1-29CTJ69CEihQPknLmP6Q/edit) to implement a command, HIL tests, logging, and tasks.

# Verification
As described in the [Onboarding Project](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1H23aaEJ0PNJ2So-cSFxMD1-29CTJ69CEihQPknLmP6Q/edit), 

# Estimated Difficulty Rating

In general, this is where details about the difficulty will go, for now, it will be set to 1.

## Explanation of difficulty rating scale:
1 - Relatively straightforward and easy to complete. Suitable for new team members.

2 - More complex / time-consuming, will likely require more time and familiarity with the satellite and embedded systems.

3 - Very complex / time-consuming, will require pathfinding of requirements & implementation, and understanding of the overall mission.


**Good luck and let us know if you have issues! Remember, if you are stuck on anything it is entirely reasonable to reach out for help, this task is meant to push the boundaries of your knowledge. Julian's rule of thumb is that if you are stuck on any one problem for more than half an hour it is worth asking for help.**
