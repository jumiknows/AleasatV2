    //The inherent degradation is an empirical measure used to
    // account for inefficiencies that occur when scaling from a
    // single solar cell to a full solar panel. This measure
    // attempts to include effects such as the temperature of the
    // cells, packing factors, and power losses in the electrical
    // connections connecting the individual cells to form a
    // solar panel. A typical value for Id is 77% (ref see link at the top)

    // mission lifetime for computation of lifetime degredation factor
    // lifetime degredation also affects inefficiencies

    // micrometeoroid strikes also factor into the degradation.
